# mposplit

I was looking for a way to convert the `.MPO` files from the [Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3](https://www.dpreview.com/products/fujifilm/compacts/fujifilm_w3) to spatial images compatible with Apple Photos and Vision Pro. This is a piece of the puzzle, this tool will split apart an `.MPO` file into its constituent images.

## Usage

```
USAGE: mposplit <mpofile> [<mpofile2> .. <mpofilen>]
```
